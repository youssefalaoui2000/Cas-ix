The Casablanca IXP is the true entry point to the Moroccan cloud computing market, and is also a major lever for the democratization of access to very low latency cloud services for the Moroccan public. By positioning yourself at the Casablanca IXP today, you will gain a competitive advantage over providers who use traditional single-operator internet links to serve Morocco.

By connecting to the Casablanca IXP you are sure to put yourself at the same distance from all your customers regardless of their telecom operators, the connections to your services will no longer have to leave Morocco to reach you which allows you to offer record access times of the order of a few milliseconds only to any Moroccan city.
