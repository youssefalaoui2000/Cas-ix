By connecting your web server network to the Casablanca Internet Exchange Point you not only benefit from unparalleled proximity to your users at all three operators but you also connect to content distribution networks (CDNs) that are also members of the IXP.

By peering with telecom operators and CDNs you keep all your internet traffic in Morocco and reach optimal access times of only a few milliseconds.
