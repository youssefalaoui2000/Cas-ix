# How it works

Welcome to our world! The world of computer networking which enables you and your business to be online 24/7. Through cables and fibres, across continents and oceans, all over the world, all the time. And all in the blink of an eye.

When you connect to our Internet Peering Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN), you become a part of CAS-IX, the world's leading Internet Exchange. With us, you can connect to local and international networks.

We host one of the largest public peering interconnection platforms where hundreds of parties exchange large amounts of IP traffic. Peering at our switching infrastructure network, operators can easily improve the performance of their internet network and achieve low-latency and cost-effective interconnection.


The Internet Peering service is used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), carriers, content providers, enterprises and other parties that seek network optimisation.
