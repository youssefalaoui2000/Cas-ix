The CAS-IX Private Interconnect (PI) service helps two members establish a dedicated connection between each other.
For members that exchange significant traffic volumes, PI makes sharing traffic faster and more cost-effective.

Using the CAS-IX PI service is as simple as setting aside a port on your router for the PI connection and telling CAS-IX which member you’d like to connect to.

## Why use the CAS-IX PI service?

* CAS-IX manages the process end to end so you don’t have to negotiate technical or commercial terms with the data centre.

* You can activate new PI connections using your available fibre pairs at no extra recurring charge and scale your service as needed.

* Use your existing CAS-IX contract to get more services without additional invoices or admin.
