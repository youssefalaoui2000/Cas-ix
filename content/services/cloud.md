Having, fast, reliable, and secure access to cloud applications is no longer just nice to have, it’s a business-critical necessity. And while most cloud services are available through public internet channels, few offer the levels of security and low-latency required for modern working.

With CAS-IX Cloud Connect, you get direct access to all Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Google cloud services through our existing network infrastructure. It gives you a low latency connection, reliable uptime, and greater control of your traffic – benefits that aren’t consistently achievable using public internet connections.
